4. Abstract 

5. Biography 

6. Overview 

  * Peat bogs – what are they? What lives there? Importance? Peat Cycle? Production? Specificity to Alberta 

  * Alberta – how long has peat been there/ discovered when? Importance to previous production section? Alberta in general: rising temperatures? 

  * Rising temperatures in general implications for ecosystems and atmospheric 

  * GHG cycle/ emissions impacts – sulfur, N cycle, etc., contributions to GHG emissions (i.e. rising temperatures but also oil development) 

  * Possibility of acid deposition/ acidification in bogs – implications for bogs, peat cycle, and production
